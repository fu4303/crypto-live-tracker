## Live Code - [Preview](https://next-crypto-tracker.vercel.app)

## Description
- I wanted to make my second next Js project with an API that will help me use Incremental static regeneration to get live update every 2-8 seconds. 
- Using the filter method and state to ensure that a user can search for a specific coin for a quick access. This is better than just scrolling down manually just to view updates for one coin. 
- Next Js made it easier to get API data with getStaticProps async function to return an object of data and destructure it to be a prop for the main component. This help to render data to the UI which the user can see more quickly and a smooth process. 
- The thing about Next Js it really help to improve peformance also for your website.

- With the Head component and also the Image component, it improves SEO and performance. If you haven't used Next Js, I hope this will be convencing enough.
